# Values are Objects

In Scala all values are *objects*. An object is a grouping of data and operations on that data. For example, 2 is an object. The data is the integer 2, and the operations on that data are familiar operations like +, -, and so on. We call operations of an object the object's *methods*. 

## Method Calls

We interact with objects by *calling* or *invoking* methods. For example, we can get the uppercase version of a `String` by calling its `toUpperCase` method.

```scala mdoc
"Titan!".toUpperCase
```

Some methods accept *parameters* or *arguments*, which control how the method works. The `take` method, for example, takes characters from a `String`. We must pass a parameter to `take` to specify how many characters we want.

```scala mdoc
"Gilgamesh went abroad in the world".take(3)
"Gilgamesh went abroad in the world".take(9)
```

A method call is an expression, and thus evaluates to an object. This means we can chain method calls together to make more complex programs:

```scala mdoc
"Titan!".toUpperCase.toLowerCase
```

Some methods have more than one parameter.
When this is the case we separate parameters with a comma.
In the example below we use `substring` method, which copies a portion of a `String`.
It has two parameters, which specify the start and end positions that we copy.

```scala mdoc
"Gilgamesh went abroad in the world".substring(10, 14)
```

Sometimes there are two or more methods that have the same name but a different number of parameters, or parameters of different types.
We call these *overloaded methods*.
For example, the `substring` method that we saw above has two overloads: one where we specify only where want to start the substring from, and one where we specify both the start and the end.

```scala mdoc
"Gilgamesh went abroad in the world".substring(10)
"Gilgamesh went abroad in the world".substring(10, 14)
```

#### Method Call Syntax

The syntax for a method call is

```scala
anExpression.methodName(param1, ...)
```

or

```scala
anExpression.methodName
```

where

- `anExpression` is any expression (which evaluates to an object)
- `methodName` is the name of the method
- the optional `param1, ...` are one or more expressions evaluating to the parameters to the method.

## Operators

We have said that all values are objects, and we call methods with the syntax `object.methodName(parameter)`. How then do we explain expressions like `1 + 2`?

In Scala, any expression written `a.b(c)` can be written `a b c`. So these are equivalent:

```scala mdoc
1 + 2
1.+(2)
```

This first way of calling a method is known as *operator* style.
It is considered good style to only use operator style when the method is widely understand to be written that way.
For example, we write `1 + 2` because everyone understands that notation better than `1.+(2)`. However, it is bad style to write `"Gilgamesh" substring 4` instead of `"Gilgamesh".substring(4)` as `substring` is not widely known to be an operator.

#### Infix Operator Notation

Any Scala expression written `a.b(c)` can also be written `a b c`.

Note that `a b c d e` is equivalent to `a.b(c).d(e)`, not `a.b(c, d, e)`.
