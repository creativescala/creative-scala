# Part Two: Introduction

In the second part of this book we are aiming to

1. deepen our understanding of structural recursion, by using it in new contexts;
2. learn how to manipulate collections of data using standard methods `map`, `filter`, `flatMap`, and `foldLeft`;
3. define and use custom data structures of a particular kind known as algebraic data types; and
3. learn a model for understanding data known as boxes and arrows diagrams.

We'll encounter these topics in the context of *exploratory data analysis*, 
which, as the name suggests, is the process of exploring data in the hopes of finding interesting things within it.
Concretely, this means we'll be transforming data, visualizing it, and calculating statistics of it.
Exploratory data analysis is part of the larger field of *data science*, which lies at the intersection of computer science and statistics.
We will take a computational approach to statistics.
This means we'll get the computer, rather than fancy mathematics, to do the work for us,
which I think leads to a clearer understanding of these topics (particularly if you are a programmer!)
