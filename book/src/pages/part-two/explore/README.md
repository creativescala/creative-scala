# Exploring Exploratory Data Analysis

I'm assuming that you have little or no experience with statistics and data science,
so terms like "statistical inference" are not meaningful to you.
It's a lot to understand concepts when we have concrete examples of them,
so our goal here is to work through a complete example of data exploration and analysis.
This will ground all the concepts which we will then work through in more detail in later chapters.
