# Part One: Introduction

With the setup complete we're ready to start learning to program! 
In this first part of the book, which covers several chapters, we have four learning goals:

1. to understand a basic model of how code runs, known as the substitution model of evaluation;
2. to apply structural recursion over the natural numbers;
3. to understand composition and abstraction using functions; and
4. to get comfortable writing, running, and debugging code.

We'll do this by creating computer graphics, part of subfield of computing known as [creative coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding).
In doing so we'll get a little bit of experience as a creative coder, 
though we won't have the time to explore more than a tiny fraction of the field.
If you decide you'd like to continue with creative coding,
at the end of this part are some resources to go further.
