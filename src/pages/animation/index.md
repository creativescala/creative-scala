# Animation and Fireworks

This chapter consolidates some of the topics we've just learned, namely functions and lists, and introduces animations as a new way working with them. This will expand how we think about these programming concepts, and give us a new creative outlet in which to explore them.

If you run the examples from the SBT console within Doodle they will just work. If not, you will need to start your code with the following imports to make Doodle available.

```scala mdoc:silent
import doodle.core._
import doodle.image._
import doodle.image.syntax._
import doodle.image.syntax.core._
import doodle.java2d._
import doodle.reactor._
```
