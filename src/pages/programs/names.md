## Names

```tut:invisible
import doodle.core._
import doodle.core.Image._
import doodle.syntax._
import doodle.jvm.Java2DFrame._
import doodle.backend.StandardInterpreter._
```

In the previous section we introduced a lot of new concepts.
In this section we'll explore one of those concepts: naming values.

We use names to refer to things.
For example, "Professeur Emile Perrot" refers to a very fragrant rose variety, while "Cherry Parfait" is a highly disease resistant variety but barely smells at all.
Much ink has been spilled, and many a chin stroked, on how exactly this relationship works in spoken language.
Programming languages are much more constrained, which allows us to be much more precise: names refer to values.
We will sometimes say names are *bound* to values, or a name introduces a *binding*.
Wherever we would write out a value we can instead use its name, if the value has a name.
In other words, a name evaluates to the value it refers to.
This naturally raises the question: how do we give names to values?
There are several ways to do this in Scala.
Let's see a few.


### Object Literals

We have already seen an example of declaring an object literal.

```tut:silent:book
object Example {
  (circle(100) fillColor Color.paleGoldenrod lineColor Color.indianRed).draw
}
```

This is a literal expression, like other literals we've seen so far, but in this case it creates an object with the name `Example`.
When we use the name `Example` in a program it evaluates to that object.

```scala
Example
// Example.type = Example$@76c39258
```

Try this in the console a few times.
Do you notice any difference in uses of the name?
You might have noticed that the *first* time you entered the name `Example` a picture was drawn, but on subsequent uses this didn't happen.
The first time we use an object's name the body of the object is evaluated and the object is created.
On subsequent uses of the name the object already exists and is not evaluated again.
We can tell there is a difference in this case because the expression inside the object calls the `draw` method.
If we replaced it with something like `1 + 1` (or just dropped the call to `draw`) we would not be able to tell the difference.
We'll have plenty more to say about this in a later chapter.

We might wonder about the type of the object we've just created.
We can ask the console about this.

```scala
:type Example
// Example.type
```

The type of `Example` is `Example.type`, a unique type that no other value has.


### `val` Declarations

Declaring an object literal mixes together object creation and defining a name.
It would be useful if we could separate the two, so we could give a name to a pre-existing object.
A `val` declaration allows us to do this.

We use `val` by writing

```scala
val <name> = <value>
```

replacing `<name>` and `<value>` with the name and the expression evaluating to the value respectively.
For example

```tut:silent:book
val one = 1
val anImage = Image.circle(100).fillColor(Color.red)
```

These two declarations define the names `one` and `anImage`.
We can use these names to refer to the values in later code.

```tut:book
one
anImage
```


### Declarations

We've talked about declarations and definitions above.
It's now time to be precise about what these terms mean, and to look in a bit more depth at the differences between `object` and `val`.

We already know about expressions.
They are a part of a program that evaluates to a value.
A *declaration* or *definition* is another part of a program, but do not evaluate to a value.
Instead they give a name to something---not always to a value as you can declare types in Scala, though we won't spend much time on this.
Both `object` and `val` are declarations.

One consequence of declarations being separate from expressions is we can't write program like

```tut:fail:book
val one = ( val aNumber = 1 )
```

because `val aNumber = 1` is not an expression and thus does not evaluate to a value.

We can however write

```tut:book
val aNumber = 1
val one = aNumber
```


### The Top-Level

It seems a bit unsatisfactory to have both `object` and `val` declarations, as they both give names to values.
Why not just have `val` for declaring names, and make `object` just create objects without naming them?
Can you declare an object literal without a name?

<div class="solution">
No, Scala doesn't allow us to do this.
For example, we can't write

```tut:fail:book
object {}
```

We have to give a name to any object literal we create.
</div>

Scala distinguishes between what is called the *top-level* and other code.
Code at the top-level is code that doesn't have any other code wrapped around.
In other words it is something we can write in a file and Scala will compile without having to wrap it in an `object`.

We've seen that expressions aren't allowed at the top-level.
Neither are `val` definitions.
Object literals, however, are.

This distinction is a bit annoying.
Some other languages don't have this restriction.
In Scala's case it comes about because Scala builds on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which was designed to run Java code.
Java makes a distinction between top-level and other code, and Scala is forced to make this distinction to work with the JVM.
The Scala console *doesn't* make this top-level distinction (we can think of everything written in the console being wrapped in some object) which can lead to confusion when we first start using Scala.

If an object literal is allowed at the top-level, but a `val` definition is not, does this mean we can declare a `val` inside an object literal?
If we can declare a `val` inside an object literal, can we later refer to that name?

<div class="solution">
We sure can!

We can put a `val` inside an object literal like so:

```tut:silent:book
object Example {
  val hi = "Hi!"
}
```

We can then refer to it using the `.` syntax we've been using already.

```tut:book
Example.hi
```

Note that we can't use `hi` on it's own

```tut:fail:book
hi
```

We have to tell Scala we want to refer to the name `hi` defined inside the object `Example`.
</div>


### Scope

If you did the last exercise (and you did, didn't you?) you'll have seen that a name declared inside an object can't be used outside the object without also referring to the object that contains the name.
Concretely, if we declare

```tut:book
object Example {
  val hi = "Hi!"
}
```

we can't write

```tut:fail:book
hi
```

We must tell Scala to look for `hi` inside `Example`.

```tut:book
Example.hi
```

We say that a name is *visible* in the places where it can be used without qualification, and we call the places where a name is visible its *scope*.
So using our fancy-pants new terminology, `hi` is not visible outside of `Example`, or alternatively `hi` is not in scope outside of `Example`.

How do we work out the scope of a name?
The rule is fairly simple: a name is visible from the point it is declared to the end of the nearest enclosing braces (braces are `{` and `}`).
In the example above `hi` is enclosed by the braces of `Example` and so is visible there.
It's not visible elsewhere.

We can declare object literals inside object literals, which allows us to make finer distinctions about scope.
For example in the code below

```tut:silent:book
object Example1 {
  val hi = "Hi!"

  object Example2 {
    val hello = "Hello!"
  }
}
```

`hi` is in scope in `Example2` (`Example2` is defined within the braces that enclose `hi`).
However the scope of `hello` is restricted to `Example2`, and so it has a smaller scope than `hi`.

What happens if we declare a name within a scope where it is already declared?
This is known as *shadowing*.
In the code below the definition of `hi` within `Example2` shadows the definition of `hi` in `Example1`

```tut:silent:book
object Example1 {
  val hi = "Hi!"

  object Example2 {
    val hi = "Hello!"
  }
}
```

Scala let's us do this, but it is generally a bad idea as it can make code very confusing.

We don't have to use object literals to create new scopes.
Scala allows us to create a new scope just about anywhere by inserting braces.
So we can write

```tut:silent:book
object Example {
  val good = "Good"

  // Create a new scope
  {
    val morning = good ++ " morning"
    val toYou = morning ++ " to you"
  }

  val day = good ++ " day, sir!"
}
```

`morning` (and `toYou`) is declared within a new scope. We have no way to refer to this scope from the outside (it has no name) so we cannot refer to `morning` outside of the scope where it is declared.
If we had some secrets that we didn't want the rest of the program to know about this is one way we could hide them.

The way nested scopes work in Scala is called *lexical scoping*.
Not all languages have lexical scoping.
For example, Ruby and Python do not, and Javascript has only recently acquired lexical scoping.
It is the authors' opinion that creating a language without lexical scope is an idea on par with eating a bushel of Guatemalan insanity peppers and then going to the toilet without washing your hands.


### Exercises {-}

Test your understanding of names and scoping by working out the value of `answer` in each case below.

```tut:silent:book
val a = 1
val b = 2
val answer = a + b
```

<div class="solution">
A simple example to get started with. `answer` is `1 + 2`, which is `3`.
</div>

```tut:silent:book
object One {
  val a = 1

  object Two {
    val a = 3
    val b = 2
  }

  object Answer {
    val answer = a + Two.b
  }
}
```

<div class="solution">
Another simple example. `answer` is `1 + 2`, which is `3`. `Two.a` is not in scope where `answer` is defined.
</div>

```tut:silent:book
object One {
  val a = 5
  val b = 2

  object Answer {
    val a = 1
    val answer = a + b
  }
}
```

<div class="solution">
Here `Answer.a` shadows `One.a` so `answer` is `1 + 2`, which is `3`.
</div>

```tut:silent:book
object One {
  val a = 1
  val b = a + 1
  val answer = a + b
}
```

<div class="solution">
This is perfectly fine. The expression `a + 1` on the right hand side of the declaration of `b` is an expression like any other so `answer` is `3` again.
</div>

```tut:silent:book
object One {
  val a = 1

  object Two {
    val b = 2
  }

  val answer = a + b
}
```

<div class="solution">
This code doesn't compile as `b` is not in scope where `answer` is declared.
</div>

```tut:fail:silent:book
object One {
  val a = b - 1
  val b = a + 1

  val answer = a + b
}
```

<div class="solution">
Trick question! This code doesn't work. Here `a` and `b` are defined in terms of each other which leads to a circular dependency that can't be resolved.
</div>
