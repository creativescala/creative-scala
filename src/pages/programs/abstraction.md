## Abstraction

```scala mdoc:invisible
import doodle.core._
import doodle.image._
import doodle.syntax.all._
import doodle.image.syntax.all._
import doodle.java2d._
```

We've learned a lot about names in the previous section.
If we want to use fancy programmer words, we could say that *names abstract over expressions*.
This usefully captures the essence of what defining names does, so let's decode the programmer-talk.

To abstract means to remove unnecessary details.
For example, numbers are an abstraction.
The number "one" is never found in nature as a pure concept.
It's always one object, such as one apple, or one copy of Creative Scala.
When doing arithmetic the concept of numbers allows us to abstract away the unnecessary detail of the exact objects we're counting and manipulate the numbers on their own.

Similarly a name stands in for an expression.
An expression tells us how to construct a value.
If that value has a name then we don't need to know anything about how the value is constructed.
The expression can have arbitrary complexity, but we don't have to care about this complexity if we just use the name.
This is what it means when we say that names abstract over expressions.
Whenever we have an expression we can substitute a name that refers to the same value.

Abstraction makes code easier to read and write.
Let's take as an example creating a sequence of boxes like shown in @:fref(programs:sequential-boxes).

@:figure{ img = "./src/pages/programs/sequential-boxes.pdf+svg", key = "#fig:programs:sequential-boxes", caption = "Five boxes filled with Royal Blue" }

We can write out a single expression that creates the picture.

```scala mdoc:silent
Image.rectangle(40, 40)
     .strokeWidth(5.0)
     .strokeColor(Color.royalBlue.spin(30.degrees))
     .fillColor(Color.royalBlue)
     .beside(
       Image.rectangle(40, 40)
         .strokeWidth(5.0)
         .strokeColor(Color.royalBlue.spin(30.degrees))
         .fillColor(Color.royalBlue)
     ).beside(
        Image.rectangle(40, 40)
          .strokeWidth(5.0)
          .strokeColor(Color.royalBlue.spin(30.degrees))
          .fillColor(Color.royalBlue)
     ).beside(
        Image.rectangle(40, 40)
             .strokeWidth(5.0)
             .strokeColor(Color.royalBlue.spin(30.degrees))
            .fillColor(Color.royalBlue)
     ).beside(
        Image.rectangle(40, 40)
             .strokeWidth(5.0)
             .strokeColor(Color.royalBlue.spin(30.degrees))
             .fillColor(Color.royalBlue)
     )
```

In this code it is difficult to see the simple pattern within.
Can you really tell at a glance that all the rectangles are exactly the same?
If we make the abstraction of naming the basic box the code becomes much easier to read.

```scala mdoc:silent
val box =
  Image.rectangle(40, 40)
       .strokeWidth(5.0)
       .strokeColor(Color.royalBlue.spin(30.degrees))
       .fillColor(Color.royalBlue)

box.beside(box).beside(box).beside(box).beside(box)
```

Now we can easily see how the box is made, and easily see that the final picture is that box repeated five times.


### Exercises {-}

#### Archery Again {-}

Let's return to the archery target we created in an earlier chapter, shown in @:fref(programs:target3).

@:figure{ img = "./src/pages/programs/target3.pdf+svg", key = "#fig:programs:target3", caption = "The Archery Target" }

Last time we created the image we didn't know how to name values, so we can to write one large expression.
This time around, give the components of the image names so that it is easier for someone else to understand how the image is constructed.
You'll have to use your own taste to decide what parts should be named and what parts don't warrant names of their own.

<div class="solution">
We decided to name the target, stand, and ground, as shown below.
This makes is clear how the final image is constructed.
Naming more components seemed to us that it would not aid comprehension.

```scala mdoc:silent
val coloredTarget =
  (
    Image.circle(10).fillColor(Color.red) on
      Image.circle(20).fillColor(Color.white) on
      Image.circle(30).fillColor(Color.red)
  )

val stand =
  Image.rectangle(6, 20) above Image.rectangle(20, 6).fillColor(Color.brown)

val ground =
  Image.rectangle(80, 25).strokeWidth(0).fillColor(Color.green)

val image = coloredTarget above stand above ground
```
</div>


#### Streets Ahead {-}

For a more compelling use of names, create a street scene like that shown in @:fref(programs:street).
By naming the individual components of the image you should be able to avoid a great deal of repetition.

@:figure{ img = "./src/pages/programs/street.pdf+svg", key = "#fig:programs:street", caption = "A Street Scene" }

<div class="solution">
Here's our solution.
As you can see, by breaking the scene down into smaller components we were able to write relatively little code.

```scala mdoc:reset:invisible
import doodle.core._
import doodle.image._
import doodle.syntax.all._
import doodle.image.syntax.all._
import doodle.java2d._
```
```scala mdoc:silent
val roof = Image.triangle(50, 30) fillColor Color.brown

val frontDoor =
  (Image.rectangle(50, 15) fillColor Color.red) above (
    (Image.rectangle(10, 25) fillColor Color.black) on
    (Image.rectangle(50, 25) fillColor Color.red)
  )

val house = roof above frontDoor

val tree =
  (
    (Image.circle(25) fillColor Color.green) above
    (Image.rectangle(10, 20) fillColor Color.brown)
  )

val streetSegment =
  (
    (Image.rectangle(30, 3) fillColor Color.yellow) beside
    (Image.rectangle(15, 3) fillColor Color.black) above
    (Image.rectangle(45, 7) fillColor Color.black)
  )

val street = streetSegment beside streetSegment beside streetSegment

val houseAndGarden =
  (house beside tree) above street

val image = (
  houseAndGarden beside
  houseAndGarden beside
  houseAndGarden
) strokeWidth 0
```
</div>
