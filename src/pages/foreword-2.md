# Foreword to the Second Edition

The real foreword will be written when the book is almost finished and I'll have a better idea of how I've been able to realize my goals for the book. Nonetheless it's useful to have something here so people reading the drafts (which I intend to post soon) have some idea of the goals.

Compared to the first edition, the intention for the second edition of Creative Scala is:

- to cover more material, so that one can read Creative Scala and be reasonably comofortable programming in Scala (or another languages; a majority of the material should be transferable);

- show how the concepts apply to more domains than the "creative computing" examples that make up the first edition. I'm currently thinking of web development, data analysis, and possibly interpreters;

- serve as a solid basis for building the ScalaBridge curriculum; and

- aiming for great rather than good enough.

I'm still keeping the same focus on programmers who are new to coding and without a STEM background. This means some material on process that might be absent when targetting more experienced developers.

One more thing: the name may change as well! I'm not sure Creative Scala fits the book I'm aiming for.
