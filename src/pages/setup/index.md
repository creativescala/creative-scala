# Getting Started

Our first step is to install the software we need to work with Creative Scala. We describe two pathways here:

1. Working with a text editor and a terminal. *We recommend this setup to people completely new to programming* as there are fewer moving parts.
2. Working with IntelliJ IDEA. We recommend this setup to people who are used to using an IDE or are uncomfortable with the terminal.

If you're an experienced developer with a setup you are happy with just keep the tools you know and adapt the instructions below as needed.

If all this stuff is new to you, the rest of the chapter has some background.
