## The Chessboard

```scala mdoc:invisible
import doodle.core._
import doodle.image._
import doodle.syntax.all._
import doodle.image.syntax.all._
import doodle.java2d._
```

In this exercise and the next we're trying to sharpen your eye for recursive structure.

Our first image is the chessboard. Though arguably not a fractal, the chessboard does contain itself: a 4x4 chessboard can be constructed from 4 2x2 chessboards, an 8x8 from 4 4x4s, and so on. The picture in @:fref(fractals:chessboards) shows this.

@:figure{ img = "./src/pages/fractals/chessboards.pdf+svg", key = "#fig:fractals:chessboards", caption = "Chessboards generated by `count` from 0 to 2." }

Your mission in this exercise is to identify the recursive structure in a chessboard, and implement a method to draw chessboards.
The method skeleton is

```scala mdoc:silent
def chessboard(count: Int): Image =
  ???
```

Implement `chessboard`. Remember we can use the structural recursion skeleton and reasoning technique to guide our implementation.

<div class="solution">
`chessboard` is a structural recursion over the natural numbers, so right away we can write down the skeleton for this pattern.

```scala
def chessboard(count: Int): Image =
  count match {
    case 0 => resultBase
    case n => resultUnit add chessboard(n-1)
  }
```

As before we must decide on the base, unit, and addition for the result.
We've given you a hint by showing the progression of chessboards in @:fref(recursion:chessboards).
From this we can see that the base is a two-by-two chessboard.

```scala mdoc:silent
val blackSquare = Image.rectangle(30, 30).fillColor(Color.black)
val redSquare   = Image.rectangle(30, 30).fillColor(Color.red)

val base =
  (redSquare.beside(blackSquare)).above(blackSquare.beside(redSquare))
```

Now to work out the unit and addition.
Here we see a change from previous examples.
The unit is the value we get from the recursive call `chessboard(n-1)`.
The addition operation is `(unit beside unit) above (unit beside unit)`.

Putting it all together we get

```scala mdoc:reset:invisible
import doodle.core._
import doodle.image._
import doodle.syntax.all._
import doodle.image.syntax.all._
import doodle.java2d._
```
```scala mdoc:silent
def chessboard(count: Int): Image = {
  val blackSquare = Image.rectangle(30, 30).fillColor(Color.black)
  val redSquare   = Image.rectangle(30, 30).fillColor(Color.red)

  val base =
    (redSquare.beside(blackSquare)).above(blackSquare.beside(redSquare))
  count match {
    case 0 => base
    case n =>
      val unit = chessboard(n-1)
      (unit.beside(unit)).above(unit.beside(unit))
  }
}
```
</div>

If you have prior programming experience you might have immediately thought of creating a chessboard via two nested loops.
Here we're taking a different approach by defining a larger chessboard as a composition of smaller chessboards.
Grasping this different approach to decomposing problems is a key step in becoming proficient in functional programming.


## Sierpinkski Triangle

The Sierpinski triangle, show in @:fref(fractals:sierpinski), is a famous fractal. (Technically, @:fref(fractals:sierpinski) shows a Sier*pink*ski triangle.)

@:figure{ img = "./src/pages/fractals/sierpinski.pdf+svg", key = "#fig:recursion:sierpinski", caption = "The Sierpinski triangle." }

Although it looks complicated we can break the structure down into a form that we can generate with structural recursion over the natural numbers.
Implement a method with skeleton

```scala mdoc
def sierpinski(count: Int): Image =
  ???
```

No hints this time.
We've already seen everything we need to know.

<div class="solution">
The key step is to recognise that the basic unit of the Sierpinski triangle is `triangle above (triangle beside triangle)`.
Once we've worked this out, the code has exactly the same structure as `chessboard`.
Here's our implementation.

```scala mdoc:reset:invisible
import doodle.core._
import doodle.image._
import doodle.syntax.all._
import doodle.image.syntax.all._
import doodle.java2d._
```
```scala mdoc
def sierpinski(count: Int): Image = {
  val triangle = Image.triangle(10, 10).strokeColor(Color.magenta)
  count match {
    case 0 => triangle.above(triangle.beside(triangle))
    case n =>
      val unit = sierpinski(n-1)
      unit.above(unit.beside(unit))
  }
}
```
</div>
