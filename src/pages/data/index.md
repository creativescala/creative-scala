# Creating and Working With Data

So far we've been working with data provided by Doodle, such as `Color`, `Point`, and `Image`. In this section we'll learn how to create and use our own data. 

Specifically we'll cover:

- creating and using `case classes`;
- creating and using `sealed traits`; and
- algebraic data types, and structural recursion over algebraic data types.
